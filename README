This file is a project made by a group of 5 people, with 2 coders.

Game - The game itself plays out as more of a hybrid of a life-management sim and a normal resource management game.
The user is put into the shoes of either a single person (easy difficulty), couple (medium difficulty), or family (hard difficulty) living in a town facing a water crisis.
The game requires the user to help the family manage their limited water supply and make it last throughout a whole month -- up until when the shortage ends.
